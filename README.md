The Assembly code here is developed for the DRAGON12-Light Trainer Rev. D which is a
low-cost, feature-packed training board for the Freescale HCS12 microcontroller family. It is
compatible with the Freescale 9S12DP256EVB board and other similar development boards on
the market today, but it also incorporates many on-board peripherals.
