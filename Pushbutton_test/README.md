Eight switches in a dual-inline package (DIP) are connected to port H. When a DIP switch is up, the associated input is 1. Otherwise, the input is 0. Four pushbuttons share the connected with the lower four DIP switches. When port H is programmed as an output port, the DIP switches and pushbuttons are ignored. (For the best result, all eight DIP switches should be at the down position.)
